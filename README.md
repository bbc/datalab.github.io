## Come and work with us!

Here at the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk), we're embarking on an ambitious _Connected Data Strategy_ to better provide audiences with the content they love. Our products reach hundreds of millions of users around the world, with billions of page views and video plays each week.

The Datalab team is using emerging machine learning techniques to enrich and augment knowledge we already possess about our content. We're harnessing this knowledge to build tools that connect the BBC together, allowing us to deliver exciting new experiences to our audience.

We're looking for great people to help us shape both our technical direction and our audience-facing products. Co-located with our Voice + AI team, you'll join a project that is at the forefront of data science. We're on the hunt for:

* Android and iOS software engineers (all levels)
* Lead data architect
* Executive product manager
* Lead data engineer (machine learning)
* Data scientists (all levels)

We are lean and move quickly to build, test and learn as we go, so your contribution will count from day one. Everyone is responsible for our collective success. To get an idea of how we work, see some of what we've been up to recently:

* Beth has been writing about [building software on Google Cloud Platform](https://medium.com/@betandr/how-we-deliver-with-gcp-at-the-bbc-1c9812acf3a1)
* Theo has been talking about [semantic web and linked data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz3YEX8NgtI)
* Gabriel has been writing and talking about [how to use data science in businesses](https://www.london.edu/faculty-and-research/lbsr/iie-podcast-how-data-science-can-boost-business) and [the value of big data](https://www.london.edu/faculty-and-research/lbsr/making-big-data-deliver)

If you have relevant experience and are excited by the idea of having a big impact on BBC audiences, please get in touch. Knowledge of video and conversational UIs, machine learning, Google Cloud Platform or personalisation is a bonus, but not a requirement.

You’ll engage with colleagues working on other BBC services, tapping into the wealth of experience of an organisation already serving a vast global audience. Learning is important to us, and you’ll have the space and opportunity to develop --- for example through the BBC's renowned [internal training academy](https://www.bbc.co.uk/academy), attending or speaking at conferences, or collaborating with other industry experts.
